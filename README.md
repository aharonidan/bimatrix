This repository contains an implementation of an algorithm described by Anne Balthasar (2009) for computing the index of an equilibrium component of a degenerate bimatrix game.

Live running version of this program can be found in [https://bimatrix.herokuapp.com](https://bimatrix.herokuapp.com).

`index_algorithm.py` contains the core of the algorithm and is located at the root directory of the project.

A light-weight Flask based web server can be found in the above `app.py` file.

See `Installation Instructions.pdf` for more details.
